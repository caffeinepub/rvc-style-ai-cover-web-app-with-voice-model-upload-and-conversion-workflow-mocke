  "summary": "Most frontend changes align with rebuilding the Replicate-based conversion flow, resolving the selected model’s direct URL from the backend, improving Replicate output handling, and implementing robust preview playback via Blob/ObjectURL with cleanup and user-facing playback errors. However, from the provided (truncated) backend diff, it is not clearly evidenced that the backend stores the converted audio as the completed job blob as required.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "The created job in the backend must store the converted audio bytes as the completed job blob (i.e., preview/download uses the converted audio).",
      "reason": "The frontend now uploads the converted audio bytes to the backend, but the shown backend implementation of makeVoiceConversionJob sets the job status to #processing and stores the uploaded audio under inputVoiceAudio; the diff excerpt does not show the logic that sets status to #completed with blob = (converted audio). Because the backend code is truncated right where completion is implied, there is insufficient evidence that the completed job blob is actually set to the converted audio.",
